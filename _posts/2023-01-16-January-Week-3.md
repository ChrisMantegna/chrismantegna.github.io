Reflecting on the legacy of D. King in the wake of contaminated water still in Mississippi and Lousiana, the deaths of 3 Black men at the hands of LAPD just last week, and the news that the reparations program piloted in a Chicago enclave has been purposefully mismanaged leave me to wonder how to fight back. It is hard to focus on the work when the basic needs of so many aren't being met.
