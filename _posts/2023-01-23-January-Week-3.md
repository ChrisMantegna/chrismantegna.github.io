The most meaningful science is the science that is communicated - there is no use is doing work to keep it to yourself! To meet my annual goal of grant application submissions and more broadly to get into the habit of science writing, I have created/ participated in two co-writing spaces weekly. On Monday & Wednesday mornings I write with a non-UW graduate student, and on Tuesday afternoons I write with fellow SAFS graduate students. Both of these spaces definitely center writing, but are comfortable accountability tools. We're building a community where we share some identities and can support each other through some common events and goals. Adding these accountabilities to my schedule helps me monitor the time I'm spending just looking at cool science stuff versus time working on tangible outcomes. On top of that, I can see weekly progress on all of my goals. Writing accountability groups next week will focus on my lagging website goal. I'm certain after 3 days of dedicated space to the Yellow Island site I may finish the goal before February! 

Moving forward, while continuing my work in BIOL 505, I look forward to reading Between the Tides from Ryan P Kelly, Terrie Klinger, and John J Meyer. I really enjoy how the intertidal is introduced and contexualized here. Anytime I get to see cool pictures of intertidal organisms I am a happy camper. Reading this work and using my course content, I am hopeful my summer program will come together and feel intuitive to the students.
