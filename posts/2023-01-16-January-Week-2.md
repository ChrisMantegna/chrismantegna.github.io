Reflecting on the legacy of D. King in the wake of contaminated water still in Mississippi and Lousiana, the deaths of 3 Black men at the hands of LAPD just last week, and the news that the reparations program piloted in a Chicago enclave has been purposefully mismanaged leave me to wonder how to fight back. It is hard to focus on the work when the basic needs of so many aren't being met. 

### “We must learn that passively to accept an unjust system is to cooperate with that system, and thereby to become a participant in its evil.” - MLK, Jr. 

Typically I am camp burn-it-down, but I don't want to be just a destroyer - I want to be a builder. I am a builder, my super power is being a bridge between persons and resource/ connection. I am building networks across UW campuses and community based organizations that are also focused on innovating the way we educate and work with our newest climate champions and ocean advocates.

### “We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right.” - MLK, Jr.  

There never seems to be enough hours in the day, but working my literature review together for the WDFW mussel project, the Hall Grant application, and some eventual proposal work has led to a more open and innovative way to learn about Puget Sound ecosystems, mussel physiology, and Contaminants of Concern. In doing the literature review I happened across the [Puget Sound Ecosystem Monitoring Program](https://www.psp.wa.gov/PSEMP-overview.php). There is a toxins working group that meets monthly that I have managed to get myself invited to through a few simple emails. This will be a great resource for me academically and professionally.

### “Intelligence plus character—that is the goal of true education.” - MLK, Jr.

The weight of clearing a path for others to walk with me and behind me when I'm finished is heavy. It's like having another full time job on top of the jobs I already have. It is my responsibility to do my best because of the 40,859 Science and Engineering Doctorates awarded in 2021, 2,431 were awarded to Black or African American recipients. Of that 2,431 awarded, 1,797 were awarded to Black women. That is approximately 4.4% of the awarded PhDs. It is a privilege to be on the path to increase that number. Check out the statistics for yourself at the [NSF/ NCSES site](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf23300/report).
