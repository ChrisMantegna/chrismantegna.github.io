Prior to setting new goals for February, I spent some time reviewing my January goals and what did or didn't work in accomplishing them. I completed the grant writing goals, but no other goal I set for myself over the month. I am happy to have at least started them all, but how can I use this to guide my February goals? 
* First is to take inventory of what was and was not accomplished (easy when all you have to do is look at progress bars). 
* Second, look at the timeline, was my projected goal completion reasonable? 
* Third, what were the barriers to goal completion? And finally, 
* What can I do differently next month to redistribute unment goals and maintain productivity?

Stepping through the review process I laid out above, I can see that two of the five goals were complete, one was more than halfway complete, and two were barely started. Of the three incomplete goals, one is skill development, one is knowledge base for current project, and the third is a summarization of work completed. Each present a different challenge to completion. 

 Goal | Step 1 | Step 2 | Step 3 | Step 4
 ---  | ---    | ---    | ---    | ---
Coding Practice | Not Accomplished | Reasonable | Not specific enough | Add 30 minutes to calendar 17x/ month
YI Website | Not Accomplished | Unreasonable | Didn't outline steps to completion | Break down into manageable steps
Literature Review | Not Accomplished | Reasonable | Project awaiting chemicals | Schedule time in calendar

Looking at my summary, I can see that specificity was my Achiles heel this month. Moving forward I will be SMART with my goals.
