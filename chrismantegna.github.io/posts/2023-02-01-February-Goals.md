February 1 marks the beginning of Black History Month, a celebration of Black Excellence as well as a call to action for Black radical thinking. I begin this month tired and frustrated at not only the lack of progress, but the backwards momentum that is waging war against education. My February goal is to make it - it is literally just to make it through the month feeling hopeful and maybe a little less tired. The thumbnail photo is of Angela Davis and Toni Morrison, and my banner photo is of street artwork in Curacao created by Giovanni Abath. Both remind me of a few themes for this month and beyond, and those are community, collaboration, perserverence and flexibility.  

As I continue work toward equity in STEM access, my summer REU program, and learning teaching pedagogy, my direct action goals for February are tangible, timely, and manageable. 

 Specific Goal | Measureable | Attainability | Relevance | Time Allotted
 ---  | ---    | ---    | ---    | ---
Coding Practice | 30 minutes/ day | Schedule time in calendar | Daily code strengthens skill | 8 - 10 hours/ month
YI Website | All page text | Wed/ Fri writing group time dedicated to the YI site | Summarizing work can help ID improvements in 2023 program | 8 hours/ month
Lit Review - P450 | Create spreadsheet to track | Schedule 3 1-hour AM blocks/ week | Shape prioritization of sample processing + paper writing | 12 hours/ month
Lit Review - Epigenetics | Create spreadsheet to track | Schedule 2 1-hour AM blocks/ week | Background knowledge + paper writing |8 hours/ month
Respirometry Visualization | Individual graphs for all samples | Begin by using coding practice time already on the calendar | Data to Zach to compliment his PCR results | 8-10 hours/ month

Idellistically that is 44 - 48 hours per month of tasks not including academic related tasks like lab time, meetings, coursework, etc. This is a lofty goal for the month. 

February Goals:
