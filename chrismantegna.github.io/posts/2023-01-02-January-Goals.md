Janauary is notorious for overly rigorous goal setting and mildly delusional levels of committment to brand new habits. Just like in diving, hard tasks are made easy when done purposefully, calmly, and consistently. In the spirit of consistency, I am going to make  consistent actions to build strong workflows that will serve me well as I move forward. 

January Goals:
* R coding practice (non-project based) 17 times in January
* Completion of the Yellow Island website chronicling our 2022 work
* Literature review for WDFW mussel project
* Hall Conservation Grant application submission
